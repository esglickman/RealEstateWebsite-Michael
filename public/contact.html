						<p class="aboutMe">I am a New Yorker living in Boca Raton! I have purchased 3 homes in the last 29 years ALL IN BOCA RATON!!!</p>
 
						<p>So, what does that mean to you? It means everything!! If you are a Golf, Tennis or Boating enthusiast, I can help you find the perfect community. Do you have children? I can help you with information on both public and private schools. After coaching 22 seasons of organized sports, it will be a pleasure to put you in contact with any of the youth programs from Baseball, Basketball, Soccer and Football to Ballet or Martial Arts.</p>
						 
						<p>Let's face it, after raising three kids I can even help you find a catering hall and band for a Bar or Bat Mitzvah, Quincea√±era, Sweet 16 or Wedding!</p>
						 
						<p>Purchasing a home is one of the biggest investments you will ever make. Being a first time home buyer is even a more intimidating proposition. Or maybe you are relocating like I did. Please know that I will work side by side with you to ensure that you find exactly what you are looking for and will share your excitement as we turn the keys to open the front door of your new home.</p>
						 
						<p>Are you selling your house? Clearly, I know what is important to a purchaser, but having just "downsized" after the last of my children left for college, I truly understand the emotions you experience from the moment you decide to sell. I will make sure you sell faster and for more money.</p>
						 
						<p>If you looking for an investment property you could not be in better hands, as in addition to our expertise in residential sales, my team includes some of the top nationally ranked sales professionals in the commercial sector.</p>
						 
						<p>Whether you are a buyer, seller, someone who is relocating or looking for an investment, I appreciate the opportunity to earn your trust and look forward to working with you.</p>
						 
						<p>Michael</p>
